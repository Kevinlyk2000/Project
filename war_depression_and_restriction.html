    <h1>War, Depression and Restriction, 1914-1945</h1>
    <p>
      World Wars and the Great Depression had adverse effects on Globalization.
      Major receiving countries introduced restrictions to entry. After several
      legislative attempts to make migration policy more restrictive, literacy
      test was passed in 1917. In 1921, country-specific immigration quotas were
      imposed. Quotas favored countries from northwestern Europe and restricted
      southern and eastern European immigration.Restrictions followed some
      country-specific restrictions happening earlier, such as the Chinese
      Exclusion Act of 1882 and "gentleman's agreement" with Japan in 1907 to
      reduce Japanese immigration. Great Depression (1929-1939) decreased the
      attractiveness of the US and World Wars also disrupted transportation
      routes. Emigration restrictions also reduced opportunities for
      international migration (most notably, by the Soviet Union). As a result,
      Immigration rates fell sharply throughout the developed world. In the US,
      proportion of foreign-born reached its lowest level in 1970 (lower than
      5%).
