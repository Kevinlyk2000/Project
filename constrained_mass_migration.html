    <h1>Constrained Mass Migration, 1946-Today</h1>
    <p>
      A series of economic and policy changes prompted a new era of mass
      migration. The first change is the change in migration policy in the US in
      the 1960s. The Immigration and Nationality Act(1965) shifts away from
      country of origin quotas and into family- and skill-based migration as
      well as increases the cap of annual immigrants. There is also Dramatic
      decline in travel costs (airplanes, information through Internet).
      Besides, differences in wages between developing and developed countries
      much larger than those between Europe and the New World in the past. The
      real wages are 10 times larger in the US than those in some developing
      countries. Migration to developed countries is highly restricted,
      especially for those with less education. In general, people nowadays have
      strong incentives to immigrate to U.S but face strong legal barriers.
