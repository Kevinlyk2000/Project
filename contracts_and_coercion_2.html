    <h1>Contracts and Coercion, 1600-1790</h1>
    <h2>The Growth of Indentured Servitude</h2>
    <p>
      This kind of basic institution developed by the Virginia Company widely
      adopted and used throughout the British Colonies. Although initially all
      servants came from England, other countries started being
      represented(Irish, German, Scottish).
    </p>
    <h2>The Market for Indentured Servants</h2>
    <p>
      Active markets for indentured servants arose in Europe and in the
      Colonies: the contracts between migrants and ship masters. Servants with
      higher expected productivity were sold at higher prices. Length of
      indenture varied with age, skill, and literacy. The wage also varies by
      location. For example, servants going to West Indies received shorter
      terms to compensate undesirable destination.
    </p>
    <h2>Decline (and revival) of indentured servitude in North America</h2>
    <p>
      By the end of 18th century, indenture servitude became infrequent in North
      America. Two main economic forces explain the decline: Increasing number
      of immigrants could pay for the trip themselves (decline in transport
      costs, increase in income in sending countries) and Competition from slave
      trade (another source of labor).However, indentured servitude still used
      for Asian migration to the West Indies, South America, Hawaii and
      California (after abolition of slavery). In 1917, the British government
      prohibited the transportation of Indians for the purposes of servitude
      (this was much later than the abolition of slavery).
    </p>
    <h2>Slave trade</h2>
    <p>
      12 million slaves were involuntarily transported to the Americas, under
      horrendous conditions, and with very high mortality rates. Slaves were
      sent mainly to cotton and tobacco growing colonies in mainland North
      America and sugar growing colonies in the Caribbean. Another form of
      forced migration at this time was the shipment of convicts out of England
      and into the British Colonies.
