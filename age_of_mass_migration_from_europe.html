    <h1>Age of Mass Migration from Europe, 1850-1913</h1>
    <p>
      The acceleration of emigration rates from Europe into the New World surged
      in the 1850s, which marked the transition from "pioneer migration" to
      "mass migration". 55 million persons moved out of Europe, 71% of whom went
      to North America, 21% of whom went to South America, 7% of whom went to
      Australasia. The first wave of mass migration was related to famine and
      revolution in Europe. The second wave was associated with transition from
      sail to steam navigation: the travel time from Europe to North America
      went from 5 weeks to 12 days, travel itself is also safer and more
      predictable.
    </p>
    <h2>Why did migration rates increase so much?</h2>
    <p>
      Decline in transport costs facilitated migration. The wages is also a big
      factor. European wages on average were half of American wages. Compared to
      Europe, America was resource-abundant and labor-scarce.Demographic
      transition in Europe also plays a role: reductions in children mortality
      led to large cohorts of young adults who had fewer opportunities to
      inherit land or enter skilled occupations.
    </p>
    <h2>Who were these immigrants?</h2>
    <p>
      Most of these immigrants were single, young, unskilled males (high rates
      of labor force participation). Only 8% of these immigrants were above age
      of 40 and 2/3 of them were male. They were also more likely to be from
      urban backgrounds compared to "pioneer settlers". This is partly driven by
      increased urbanization in Europe.
    </p>
    <h2>Changing composition of immigrant flow</h2>
    <p>
      British Isles were the main source of immigrants in first half of
      19th-century, then joined by Germans in the 1840s, and rest of Northwest
      Europe in 1870s. Starting in 1880, "new immigrants" represented majority
      of inflows, who were from Southern and Eastern Europe (Italy, Poland,
      Russia, Spain, Portugal) and Even more likely to be single males, young
      adults, decline of family migration, also more likely to return (about 1/3
      returned, growing proportion over time).By 1870s, acceleration in
      migration (mainly from Italy, Portugal and Spain) to South America
      (Argentina and Brazil).
    </p>
    <h2>The end of Mass Migration: changes in US migration policy</h2>
    <p>
      Increase in immigration and shift in their origins raised concerns in the
      US. Immigration Commission (1907-1910) devoted four years to examining the
      economic and social life of immigrants and concluded that: "largely a
      movement of unskilled labouring men, who have come, in large part
      temporarily, from the less progressive and advanced countries of Europe."
      Distinction were made between "old" and "new" immigrants and
      anti-immigration rhetorics grew.
