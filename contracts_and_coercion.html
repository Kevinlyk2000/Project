    <h1>Contracts and Coercion, 1600-1790</h1>
    <p>
      Discovery of the Americas stimulates a steady but small migration ow from
      Europe and Africa to the Americas.High costs and risky transportation made
      the trip unprofitable for most. Migration was mostly confined to military,
      merchants and seamen because migrating required being quite adventurous.By
      end of 18th Century, around 8 million people had migrated or were forced
      to migrate to the Americas, of whom 7 million are slaves and the left is
      composed of some free, non-servant immigrants and indentured servants.
    </p>
    <h2>Jamestown, Virginia</h2>
    <p>
      The Jamestown settlement in the Colony of Virginia was the first permanent
      English settlement in the Americas.It was established by the Virginia
      Company of London as "James Fort" on May 4, 1607 O.S. (May 14, 1607 N.S.),
      and was considered permanent after a brief abandonment in 1610.
    </p>
    <h2>Why did indentured servitude start?</h2>
    <p>
      The system began in 1607 when Virginia Company recruited laborers from
      England to work in its Jamestown colony. There was a critical economic
      problem of early investors in Virginia Company:How to recruit and motivate
      workers? The most obvious problem is high cost of the transportation of
      settlers: The money cost extremely high relative to wages in England (half
      of average annual earnings) and the time cost is 2 to 3 months.One
      solution could have been to borrow money in England to finance trip but
      capital markets in England not developed to deal with this situation. No
      one wants to make a loan to someone who will move 3000 miles away (in an
      era with no telephones, internet. etc.The company's solution is to loan to
      migrants, who would repay out of their earnings in America.
    </p>
    <h2>Evolution of indentured servitude: The early contracts</h2>
    <p>
      During the early period, migrants would work directly for the company in
      Virginia, in return of passage and maintenance during stay in America.
      They had a claim for the profits of the company after seven years. High
      mortality rates among servants and hard working conditions was a common
      scene in this system. Some workers would run away and those recaptured
      were subject to death penalty. One key feature of early contracts is that
      company itself employed the servants.
    </p>
    <h2>Evolution of indentured servitude: The early contracts</h2>
    <p>
      At this period, the company would send over servants to America at its own
      expense.It would then rent these servants to free colonists for a year at
      a fixed rate. The goal was to disperse servants in different groups, so as
      to improve discipline. However, there was an incentive problem of free
      planters: taking care of ill servants (who did not belong to them) and
      preventing runaways. Economist call this type of incentives problem a
      "moral hazard" problem.
    </p>
    <h2>Evolution of indentured servitude: The indenture contracts</h2>
    <p>
      The previous two arrangements (direct work for the company and rental
      contracts) created severe incentive problems. In 1619, indentured
      contracts are established: servants were sold (rather than rented) to
      independent planters for fixed term of time. Key advantages of this system
      is that planters had incentives to take care of servants, which solved the
      moral hazard problem.
    </p>
    <h2>Work incentives under indentured servitude</h2>
    <p>
      Key incentives issues are that main benefit of contract for the servant
      (trip to America) was given at the beginning of contract and few servants
      wanted to be rehired after the end of their terms, so masters had little
      incentives to treat servants well (especially close a contract's end).
    </p>
    <h2>How to incentivize workers? How to avoid runaways?</h2>
    <p>
      There was Widespread use of violence (colonial laws ordered some
      protection from "excessive" physical punishment). But also, there were
      some positive economic incentives offered: providing higher quality food
      and lodging, monetary wages, early releases, etc.
