    <h1>Pioneer Free Settlers, 1790-1850</h1>
    <p>
      Free settlers outnumbered slaves for the first time at end of 18th
      century. To a large extent, these were economic immigrants as the ones
      today. One important difference is that European migration to the Americas
      was unregulated, everyone who managed to arrive could stay.
    </p>
    <h2>Who were these immigrants?</h2>
    <p>
      Most of pioneer settlers come with their families and are from Northwest
      of Europe, ranging from farmers, craftsmen and artisans. Some came to U.S.
      to flee from war and persecution temporarily, but most intended to acquire
      land in the US and settle permanently. Many would move to the New World
      frontier (in the US, to the Midwest first and then the West).
